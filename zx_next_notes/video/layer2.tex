\section{Layer 2}
Layer 2 is a for bitmapped graphics. It supports modes with
$256\times192\times256$ resolution at global coordinates (32, 32) to
(287, 223) mapped linearly left to right/top to bottom,
$320\times256\times256$ resolution at global coordinates (0, 0) to
(318, 255) mapped top to bottom/left to right, and
$640\times256\times16$ resolution at global coordinates (0, 0) to
(319, 255) with half width pixels mapped so that the nybbles in a byte
are adjacent columns (MSN on the left) and bytes running top to
bottom/left to right. It can be mapped starting at any 16k memory
blocks. The $256\times192\times256$ mode requires 3 consecutive blocks
(48k) while the others use 5 consecutive blocks (80k).

\subsection{Configuration}
Layer 2 is enabled using port \$123B or register \$69. The mode is
selected using register \$70. How layer 2 memory is overlaid on main
memory is controled by port \$123B and register \$70. The location in
memory is controlled by register \$12 with a shadow area pointed to by
register \$13 for double buffering. Finally port \$123B is used to
select either the main RAM area or the shadow RAM area for rendering
the layer.

\subsection{Scrolling}
Scrolling Layer 2 is controlled by registers \$16 and \$17. (Is there
a third scrolling register for layer 2?)

\subsection{Clipping}
The Clip area for is based on the local coordinate system for the mode
in question and is set using register \$18 with the option of
selection which write in active using register \$1C.
