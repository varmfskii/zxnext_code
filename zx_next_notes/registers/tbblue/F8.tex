\register{R/W}{F8}{XADC REG (issue 4 only)(3.02.00)} reset = 0
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = 1 to write to XADC DRP port, 0 to read from XADC DRP port **
\item bits 6-0 = XADC DRP register address DADDR
\end{itemize}
* An XADC register read or write is initiated by writing to this register\\
* There must be at least six 28 MHz cycles after each r/w to this register\\
** Reads as 0
