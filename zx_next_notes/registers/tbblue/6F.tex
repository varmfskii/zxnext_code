\register{R/W}{6F}{Layer 3 Tile Definitions Base Address}
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = Select bank (3.01.08)
\begin{itemize}
\item[] 0 = Bank 5
\item[] 1 = Bank 7
\end{itemize}
\item bit 6 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bits 5-0 = MSB of address of the tile definitions in Bank 5 (16k) or 7
(8k) (\$0C on reset)
\end{itemize}
Soft Reset default \$0C - This is because the address is \$4C00 so the
MSB is \$4C. But the stored value is only the lower 6 bits so it's an
offset into the 16k Bank 5. To calculate therefore subtract \$40
leaving you with \$0C.

The value written is an offset into the 16k Bank 5 or the 8k lower
half of Bank 7 allowing the tilemap to be placed at any multiple of
256 bytes.
