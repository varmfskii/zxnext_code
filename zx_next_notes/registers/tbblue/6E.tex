\register{R/W}{6E}{Layer 3 Tilemap Base Address}
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = Bank Select (3.01.08)
\begin{itemize}
\item[] 0 = Bank 5
\item[] 1 = Bank 7
\end{itemize}
\item bit 6 = Reserved, must be 0
\item bits 5-0 = MSB of address of the tilemap in Bank 5 (16k) or 7 (8k)
(\$2C on reset)
\end{itemize}
Soft Reset default \$2C - This is because the address is \$6C00 so the
MSB is \$6C. But the stored value is only the lower 6 bits so it's an
offset into the 16k Bank 5. To calculate therefore subtract \$40
leaving you with \$2C.

The value written is an offset into the 16k Bank 5 or the 8k lower
half of Bank 7 allowinf the tilemap to be placed at any multiple of
256 bytes.
