\register{R/W}{64}{Vertical Line Count Offset (3.01.05)}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = Offset added to the vertical line counter
\item[] affects copper, line interrupt and active line
  count.\\
  Normally the ula's pixel row 0 aligns with vertical line count 0.
  With a non-zero offset, the ula's pixel row 0 will align with the
  vertical line offset.\\
  Eg, if the offset is 32 then vertical line 32 will correspond to
  the first pixel row in the ula and vertical line 0 will align with
  the first pixel row of the tilemap and sprites.
\end{itemize}
* Since a change in offset takes effect when the ula reaches row 0,
the change can take up to one frame to occur.
