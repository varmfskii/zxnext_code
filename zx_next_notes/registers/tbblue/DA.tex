\register{R/W}{DA}{I/O Trap Cause (experimental)(3.02.00)}
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-0 = The trap cause
\begin{itemize}
\item[] 0 = none (zero at same time as nextreg \$02 bit 4 is 0)
\item[] 1 = port \$2FFD read
\item[] 2 = port \$3FFD read
\item[] 3 = port \$3FFD write
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
* If nextreg \$02 bit 4 indicates an I/O cycle was trapped, this
  register indicates the cause
