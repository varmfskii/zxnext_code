\begin{itemize}
\item Select mode\\
Read
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = 1
\item bits 6-2 = reserved
\item bits 1-0 = currently selected device
\begin{itemize}
\item[] 00 = none
\item[] 01 = Xilinx DNA
\item[] 10 = Xilinx XADC
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Write
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = 1 to enter select mode, 0 to enter selected device mode (no other bits have effect)
\item bit 6 = 1 to change selected device
\item bits 5-2 = reserved
\item bits 1-0 = selected device
\begin{itemize}
\item[] 00 = none
\item[] 01 = Xilinx DNA
\item[] 10 = Xilinx XADC
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Xilinx DNA Mode\\
Read
\begin{itemize}
\item bits 7-1 = reserved
\item bit 0 = dna bit (serial stream shifts left)\\
the first eight bits read will indicate the length of the following
dna bits
\end{itemize}
Write
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = 1 to enter select mode (write has no other effect)\\
otherwise causes dna string to reload, ready for fresh read
\item bits 6-0 = reserved
\end{itemize}
\item Xilinx XADC Mode (Documented in Xilinx Series 7 UG480)\\
Read
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = reserved
\item bit 6 = 1 if XADC is busy with conversion (BUSY)
\item bits 5-2 = reserved
\item bit 1 = 1 if XADC conversion completed since last read (EOC, read clears)
\item bit 0 = 1 if XADC conversion sequence completed since last read (EOS, read clears)
\end{itemize}
Write
\begin{itemize}
\item bit 7 = 1 to enter select mode (write has no other effect)
\item bit 6 = 1 to reset XADC (RESET)
\item bits 5-1 = reserved
\item bit 0 = 1 to start conversion (CONVST)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
* Re-enter select mode at any time by writing to the register with bit 7 set\\
* Select a device to communicate with by writing to the register with bits 6 \& 7 set\\
* Exit select mode by writing zero to bit 7; thereafter the particular device is attached to the nextreg
