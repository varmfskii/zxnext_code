\port{E3}{divMMC Control}\\     
Disable with bit 2 of Nextreg \$09
\begin{itemize}
\item[] bit 7 = conmem, enable divMMC memory
\item[] bit 6 = mapram, enable divMMC allRAM mode
\item[] bits 5-4 = reserved
\item[] bits 3-0 = bank, selected divMMC ram bank for \$2000-\$3FFF region
\item conmem can be used to manually control divMMC mapping. When enabled\\
\$0000-\$1FFF contains esxDOS ROM or esxDOS page 3\\
\$2000-\$3FFF contains esxDOS RAM page selected by bits 3-0
\item divMMC automatically maps itself in when instruction fetches hit
specific addresses in the ROM. When this happens, the esxDOS ROM (or divMMC
bank 3 if mapram is set) appears in \$0000-\$1FFF and the selected divMMC
bank appears as RAM in \$2000-\$3FFF
\item bit 6 can only be set, once set only a power cycle can reset it.
nextreg \$09 bit 3 can be set to reset this bit.
\end{itemize}
divMMC automapping is normally disabled by NextZXOS see nextreg \$06 bit 4.\\
