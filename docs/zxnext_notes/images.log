! Package pgfkeys Error: I do not know the key '/csv/wIntelT' and I am going to
 ignore it. Perhaps you misspelled it.

See the pgfkeys package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

This error message was generated by an \errmessage
command, so I can't give any explicit help.
Pretend that you're Hercule Poirot: Examine all clues,
and deduce the truth by order and method.

! Undefined control sequence.
\csv@@body ->\opa

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
\csv@@body ->\opa &
                   \zia &\ina &\sza &\tma &\opb &\zib &\inb &\szb &\tmb 
l.393 ...&\ina&\sza&\tma&\opb&\zib&\inb&\szb&\tmb}
                                                  
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
