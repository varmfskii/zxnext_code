Relative Sprites</A>
</H2>
Normal sprites (sprites that are not relative) are known as anchor
sprites. As the sprite module draws sprites in the order 0-127 (there
are 128 sprites), it internally stores characteristics of the last
anchor sprite seen. If following sprites are relative, they inherit
some of these characteristics, which allows relative sprites to have,
among other things, coordinates relative to the anchor. This means
moving the anchor sprite also causes its relatives to move with it.

<P>
There are two types of relative sprites supported known as “Composite
Sprites” and “Unified Sprites”. The type is determined by the anchor
in the T bit of sprite attribute 4.

<P>
<DL class="COMPACT">
<DT>A.</DT>
<DD>Composite Sprites
<BR>
The sprite module records the following information from the anchor:
  
<UL>
<LI>Anchor.visible
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.Y
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.palette_offset
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.N (pattern number)
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.H (indicates if the sprite uses 4-bit patterns)
  
</LI>
</UL>
  These recorded items are not used by composite sprites:
  
<UL>
<LI>Anchor.rotate
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.xmirror
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.ymirror
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.xscale
</LI>
<LI>Anchor.yscale
  
</LI>
</UL>
  The anchor determines if all its relative sprites use 4-bit patterns or not.

<P>
The visibility of a particular relative sprite is the result of
  ANDing the anchor’s visibility with the relative sprite’s
  visibility. In other words, if the anchor is invisible then so are
  all its relatives.

<P>
Relative sprites only have 8-bit X and Y coordinates (the ninth bits
  are taken for other purposes). These are signed offsets from the
  anchor’s X,Y coordinate. Moving the anchor moves all its relatives
  along with it.

<P>
If the relative sprite has its PR bit set in sprite attribute 2,
  then the anchor’s palette offset is added to the relative sprite’s
  to determine the active palette offset for the relative
  sprite. Otherwise the relative sprite uses its own palette offset as
  usual.

<P>
If the relative sprite has its PO bit set in sprite attribute 4,
  then the anchor’s pattern number is added to the relative sprite’s
  to determine the pattern used for display. Otherwise the relative
  sprite uses its own pattern number as usual. The intention is to
  supply a method to easily animate a large sprite by manipulating the
  pattern number in the anchor.

<P>
A composite sprite is like a collection of independent sprites tied
  to an anchor.

<P>
</DD>
<DT>B.</DT>
<DD>Unified Sprites

<P>
Unified sprites are a further extension of the
  composite type. The same information is recorded from the anchor and
  the same behaviour as described under composite sprites applies.

<P>
The difference is the collection of anchor and relatives is treated
  as if it were a single <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img33.svg"
 ALT="$16\times16$"></SPAN> sprite. The anchor’s rotation,
  mirror, and scaling bits apply to all its relatives. Rotating the
  anchor causes all the relatives to rotate around the
  anchor. Mirroring the anchor causes the relatives to mirror around
  the anchor. The sprite hardware will automatically adjust X,Y coords
  and rotation, scaling and mirror bits of all relatives according to
  settings in the anchor.

<P>
Unified sprites should be defined as if all its parts are
  <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img33.svg"
 ALT="$16\times16$"></SPAN> in size with the anchor controlling the look of the
  whole.

<P>
A unified sprite is like a big version of an individual <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img33.svg"
 ALT="$16\times16$"></SPAN>
  sprite controlled by the anchor.
